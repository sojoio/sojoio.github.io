						Project Overview
					</h3>
					<div class="skill-text">
						This project evolved out of reviewing a few community-led housing websites for a group of clients. They originally wanted some amendments made to an existing site but after several discussions the project changed direction an resulted in the design of a completely new site. The website needed to be inspiring visually with modern illustration, and contain a variety of content to begin to develop an online “hub” for community led housing projects.

						My Contributions
					</h3>
					<div class="skill-text">
						I've worked with Steve on a number of projects. We've had consistently good outcomes. This project was a little different in that it is intended to grow into a hub of information. The website needed a modern feel, to be easy to navigate and simple for the company to maintain themselves. WordPress was something the client had previous experience of so was the CMS we opted for. Illustration style was discussed and developed into something that gave the site some personality. Despite changes in the initial brief the project was delivered on time, the company were satisfied with the website that was delivered and we continue to maintain a strong working relationship.
