						Project Overview
					</h3>
					<div class="skill-text">
						The objective of this project was to create a user interface for a new SaaS which would allow clients a central control application to view and manage their antivirus configuration and alerts across their estate. The application would feature alert management with complex and personalisable filtering, issue tracking and accountability as well as taking complex datasets and creating understandable visualisations as part of dashboard pages.

						My Contributions
					</h3>
					<div class="skill-text">
						This project was a completely new service for the company and I was required to undertake all elements of UI UX. I began with researching, looking at competitor projects and considering who the user may be, followed with user research, user flow, wireframing and eventually prototyping. The project was of particular interest to the CTO so regular demos were undertaken by myself. Once a design had been agreed upon I then build the UI with back end support from other team members. The design was itterated upon during development, tested and successfully released to customers. It's a well recieved addition to the companies cyber security service offering.
